# μEDH

## Guidelines

- μEDH is a deckbuilding constraint, *not a new EDH variant*:
  - All normal EDH rules and banlist apply. Every deck that is legal in μEDH is legal in EDH, but not vice versa.
  - Beating your buddies' $250 EDH "7's" with a $25 μEDH brew is highly rewarding and strongly encouraged.
- μEDH is rarity constrained, *not budget constrained*:
  - Up to 4 rares/mythics are allowed in the "99". Otherwise, only cards that were originally printed at commom/uncommon are legal in μEDH, i.e., [f:edh r<r not:reprint](https://scryfall.com/search?q=f%3Aedh+r%3Cr+not%3Areprint&unique=cards&as=grid&order=name). Commander(s) are not exempt of the constraint, i.e., [f:edh r<r not:reprint is:commander](https://scryfall.com/search?q=f%3Aedh+r%3Cr+not%3Areprint+is%3Acommander&unique=cards&as=grid&order=name).
  - μEDH has no formal budget constraint because card prices are liable to fluctuate daily, but new cards are only printed periodically. Brews just naturally tend toward inexpensive when majority comprised of commons, uncommons, and basics.
  - Decks built for other rarity-based EDH variants (e.g., Pauper EDH, Artisan Commander) struggle to compete with normal EDH decks even in Timmy metas because there are certain effects that are not printed below rare unless significantly nerfed, most importantly board wipes. Pyrohemia is good, but it will never be as effective at clearing a game ending board state as Chain Reaction.
