# μEDH

## Rules

1. Normal EDH rules and banlist apply: `f:edh`.
2. Deck must contain only cards been printed at common/uncommon: `r<r`.
3. Up to 4 cards in the "99" may be exempt to rule 2.

## Scryfall filters

- Commander: [f:edh r<r is:commander](https://scryfall.com/search?q=f%3Aedh+r%3Cr+is%3Acommander)
- "99": [f:edh r<r](https://scryfall.com/search?q=f%3Aedh+r%3Cr)

<!--## Philosophy

- μEDH is an EDH deckbuilding constraint, *not a new EDH variant*:
  - Beating your buddies' $250 EDH "7's" with a $25 μEDH brew is highly rewarding and strongly encouraged.
- μEDH is rarity constrained, *not budget constrained*:
  - μEDH has no formal budget constraint because card prices are liable to fluctuate daily, but new cards are only printed periodically. Brews just naturally tend toward inexpensive when majority comprised of commons, uncommons, and basics.
  - Decks built for other rarity-based EDH variants (e.g., Pauper EDH, Artisan Commander) struggle to compete with normal EDH decks even in Timmy metas because there are certain effects that are not printed below rare unless significantly nerfed, most importantly board wipes. Pyrohemia is good, but it will never be as effective at clearing a threatening board state as Chain Reaction.-->
