## Guidelines

- EDH subset, *not EDH variant*:
  - All normal EDH rules apply, so every deck that is legal in μEDH is legal in EDH, but not vice versa.
  - Beating your buddy's $250 EDH "7" with your $25 μEDH brew is highly encouraged.
- Rarity constrained, *not budget constrained*:
  - Up to 4 rares/mythics are allowed in the "99". Otherwise, only cards that were originally printed at commom/uncommon are legal in μEDH, i.e., [f:edh r<r -is:reprint](https://scryfall.com/search?q=f%3Aedh+r%3Cr+-is%3Areprint&unique=cards&as=grid&order=name).
  - There are no formal budget constraints; brews tend toward inexpensive when majority comprised of commons, uncommons, and basics.
